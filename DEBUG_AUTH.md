# Authentication Loading Issue Debug

## Problem
Dashboard overview shows loading animation indefinitely after refresh.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. AuthContext Loading State
The AuthContext was getting stuck in loading state because:
- Supabase environment variables might not be configured
- Session check was hanging without timeout
- No fallback for development mode

### 2. Solutions Implemented

#### A. Mock Mode for Development
- Added `isSupabaseConfigured` check in `supabaseClient.ts`
- Created mock Supabase client when env vars are missing
- Added mock user and profile for development

#### B. Timeout Protection
- Added 5-second timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Graceful fallback when auth services fail

#### C. Better Error Handling
- Proper null state management
- Clear loading state resolution

### 3. Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/supabaseClient.ts`**
   - Added configuration check
   - Mock client for development

2. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Added timeout protection
   - Mock user for development
   - Better error handling

3. **`src/pages/dashboard-overview/index.tsx`**
   - Converted to TypeScript
   - Added mock data
   - Better loading state management

### 4. Testing Steps

1. **Without Supabase (Development Mode):**
   ```bash
   # Ensure .env.local has no Supabase vars or empty ones
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Should show mock user "Demo User"
   - Dashboard should load with mock data
   - No infinite loading

2. **With Supabase:**
   ```bash
   # Set proper Supabase environment variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Should connect to real Supabase
   - Load actual user data

### 5. Expected Behavior

- **Loading state**: Maximum 5 seconds
- **No user**: Redirect to login
- **Mock mode**: Show demo user and data
- **Real mode**: Show actual user and data

### 6. Verification

The loading issue should now be resolved with:
- Timeout protection preventing infinite loading
- Mock mode for development without Supabase
- Proper error handling and state management
