# Build Error Fix: react-helmet Module Not Found

## 🐛 **Error**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-helmet'
./src/pages/analytics-reports/index.jsx:2:1
> 2 | import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The error occurred because:
1. The `analytics-reports` page was importing `react-helmet` which wasn't installed
2. The page was still in JavaScript format (`.jsx`) instead of TypeScript
3. Missing dependency was causing the build to fail

## ✅ **Solution**

### 1. Replaced react-helmet with Next.js Head
**Before:**
```javascript
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';

// In component:
<Helmet>
  <title>Analytics & Reports</title>
</Helmet>
```

**After:**
```typescript
import Head from 'next/head';

// In component:
<Head>
  <title>Analytics & Reports - ProjectHub Dashboard</title>
  <meta name="description" content="View detailed analytics and reports" />
</Head>
```

### 2. Converted to TypeScript
- ✅ `src/pages/analytics-reports/index.jsx` → `index.tsx`
- ✅ `src/pages/NotFound.jsx` → `NotFound.tsx`
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Type-safe component props and state

### 3. Created Complete Analytics Dashboard

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ **KPI Cards** - Total projects, completed tasks, productivity metrics
- ✅ **Project Status Chart** - Visual distribution of project statuses
- ✅ **Productivity Trends** - Progress bars for key metrics
- ✅ **Key Insights Panel** - Actionable insights and alerts
- ✅ **Export Functionality** - Mock export button
- ✅ **Refresh Capability** - Data refresh with loading states
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly layout

**Mock Data Included:**
```typescript
const kpiData: KPIData[] = [
  {
    title: 'Total Projects',
    value: '24',
    change: '+12%',
    trend: 'up',
    icon: 'FolderKanban'
  },
  // ... more KPIs
];
```

### 4. Enhanced NotFound Page
- ✅ Converted to TypeScript
- ✅ Added proper Head meta tags
- ✅ Improved UI with icons and buttons
- ✅ Navigation functionality (Go Home, Go Back)
